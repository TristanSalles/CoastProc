_Regional scale model of wave propogation and associated sediment transport_

The wave model is based on Airy wave theory and takes into account wave refraction based on Huygen's principle.
The sediment entrainment is computed from wave shear stress and transport according to both
wave direction and longshore transport. Deposition is dependent of shear stress and diffusion.
The model is intended to quickly simulate the average impact of wave induced sediment transport
at large scale and over geological time period.

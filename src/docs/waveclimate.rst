Coastal Ocean Observing Systems
-----------

The ocean plays a role in everyoneâ€™s life. It affects weather and climate patterns around the globe, hosts an abundance of wildlife that support fishing industries and provide food for the world, serves as a highway for vessels that deliver everyday materials, and supports economies as a tourism destination.

The coastal ocean is the part of the earth system where land, water, air, and people meet together. Populations, businesses, and infrastructure are increasing along coastlines, which are all susceptible to changing coastal ocean conditions.

.. tip::
  Now, more than ever, there is a need for regional to global observing systems that can provide accurate real-time data and forecasts on coastal ocean conditions.

**Coastal ocean observing systems** (COOS) are necessary for advancing our understanding on the state of the coastal ocean worldwide and its impact on matters of societal importance. These systems integrate a network of people, organisations, technologies, and data to share advances, improve research capabilities, and provide decision-makers with access to information and scientific interpretations.


.. important::
  Data, observations, and models integrated into the **COOS** come from a variety of platforms, including, for example, **moorings**, high-frequency (HF) **radars**, underwater **gliders** and profilers, **satellites**, and **ships**. The resulting data are used to better understand, respond to, and prepare for **short-term** events such as oil spills, harmful algal blooms, and fish kills, **longer term** changes in our oceans resulting in acidification, hypoxia, and sea level rise, and in everyday decisions related to maritime operations, public health, and management of healthy ecosystems.


Why do we need ocean observing tools?

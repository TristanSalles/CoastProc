Coral reef evolution
=================

The Great Barrier Reef is the largest living organism on the planet, stretching over 2,600 kilometres in length and covering 344,400km2 of the ocean. It consists of 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands.

The growth and evolution of the reef did not happen overnight. In fact, it is over 20 million years in the making. The reef as we know it today is built on the backs and bones of many millions of years of coral as the ocean levels have changed, islands have formed and land has settled.

The current formation that we know is about 6,000 to 8,000 years old and sits on the platform of a much older reef. The formation, location and depth have changed as the continental shelf and sea level have changed and will likely continue to do as sea levels change and the earth's crust shifts.




Stratigraphic Forward Modelling (SFM) has become a powerful tool applied to predict stratigraphic architecture of sedimentary systems. By simulating processes acting over geologic timescales, the approach consists in iteratively refining parameters to improve the match between observed and predicted morphologies and stratigraphies (Fig. 1). Through this iterative procedure, it helps to evaluate and quantify parameters that cannot be observed directly from the fossil record, such as sedimentation or carbonate production rates. In that sense, SFMs address the short-comings of qualitative investigation techniques applied to carbonate systems. Several numerical models have been developed since the 1960s to investigate the evolution of carbonate systems, yet only recently have the complexity of biological interactions started to be addressed.

Coral reef evolution
=================

The Great Barrier Reef is the largest living organism on the planet, stretching over 2,600 kilometres in length and covering 344,400km2 of the ocean. It consists of 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands.

The growth and evolution of the reef did not happen overnight. In fact, it is over 20 million years in the making. The reef as we know it today is built on the backs and bones of many millions of years of coral as the ocean levels have changed, islands have formed and land has settled.

.. note::
  The GBR that we know is about 6,000 to 8,000 years old and sits on the platform of a much older reef. The formation, location and depth have changed as the continental shelf and sea level have changed and will likely continue to do as sea levels change and the earth's crust shifts.


Amongst the approaches available to study coral reef platform formation, **Stratigraphic Forward Modelling** (SFM) has become a powerful tool. SFM simulates processes acting over geologic timescales and consists in iteratively refining parameters to improve the match between observed and predicted morphologies and stratigraphies. Through this iterative procedure, it helps to *evaluate* and *quantify* parameters that cannot be observed directly such as sedimentation or carbonate production rates. In that sense, SFMs address the short-comings of qualitative investigation techniques applied to carbonate systems.
